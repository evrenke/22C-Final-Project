# 22C-Final-Project

The final project for my C++ data structures and algorithms class. It creates both a hash table and BST of pointers
that both store data of "phone contacts" with names, numbers, addresses, and GPS coordinates.

The pointer hash table and BST are the key components of this project. In my opinion, looking back I could have implemented the hash table
in a better way, but due to inexperience and time constraints I had to take un-generalizable shortcuts.

The application allows the modification and searching of contacts, as well as location comparisons that give 
an estimate of distance like a simplified map.
